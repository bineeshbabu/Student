In that case, how can I flush away any remaining bytes from last read before calling the second SSL_Write? Can I fflush(SSL_get_rfd(sslObj))?",

            "Even before Amazon go, there was this guy from Wayanad in Kerala who pioneered the idea. He started with delivering Dosa batter in Bengaluru and later expanded to state of the art technology driven food items sales. He now has many such places where you walk in and take away anything. But the important difference you pay cash and take the change back on your own unlike Amazon go where it's billed by the RF scanning. We attended a meeting where he spoke about it. He said that the idea of mutual trust with customers was so powerful. He said in some places he got more money than the collective MRP of all items sold. Now reliance is supposedly copying his idea",

If you’re unavailable, make sure you inform us prior. All the office hours will be held over Zoom.us application (which we’re using at the moment). Pro Tip: Download Zoom app on mobile & PC to join calls immediately without any delays. ",

Then after that on the 2nd pass of the while loop and so forth it doesn't grab the new input. The string stream seems to leave the original first values for some reason.",
